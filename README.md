# Trail Titans

What you see here is the source code for http://trailtitans.com, a website that approximates Google Street View for high-elevation mountains. Check out the site itself to learn more about the project.

I built v1 of this site in a couple of months, and I continue to maintain the site as we seek funding to add more mountains.

    'location': 'Mendoza, Argentina',
    'route': 'Normal Route',
    'season': 'December - February',
    'description': "Not only the tallest mountain in the Andes, Aconcagua is the highest mountain outside the Himalaya. Though not particularly technical, it will definitely test your endurance. You'll climb over 4,000 vertical meters and spend 10-17 days on the mountain, so make sure to call mom before you leave. The expedition will cost about $5,000. Bring lots of cash - the unofficial exchange rate in Mendoza will give you 50% more buying power than your Visa. The mules will take your bags as far as Plaza de Mulas. After Mulas you can hire porters, who will charge about $700 to get your bag to high camp. Make good use of the bathrooms in Confluencia and Plaza de Mulas. Any post-Mulas poop has to be hiked out in bags, which is extra heavy if you just ate llama or chorizo. Also, keep your eyes peeled for the bridge near the beginning. It was built for Brad Pitt's 1997 movie Seven Years in Tibet."

    'description': "Acotango is a volcano that can be climbed from Sajama National Park in Bolivia. You can also start the hike from Lauca National Park just over the border in Chile. But that route is littered with land mines, so we recommend you stick to the Bolivian side unless you're doing field research for the UN Office for Disarmament Affairs. This climb isn't technical, but the views are impressive. Look for Nevada Sajama, Bolivia's tallest mountain, in the distance."

    'season': 'May - October',
    'description': "Half Dome is the most epic North American hike. It starts in Yosemite Valley, winds up the Mist Trail, through Little Yosemite Valley and onto Half Dome. About a mile into the hike, the trail splits into the Mist Trail and the John Muir Trail (JMT). We recommend taking the Mist Trail up and the JMT down. Mist Trail is more dangerous going down, but more direct going up. Unless you’re training to climb Everest, don't carry much water. Instead, bring a couple small bottles and a filter. You'll find several water sources on your way up."

    'description': "Huayna Potosi is the most popular mountain in La Paz. Climbing this mountain is a great way to acclimatize for a taller mountain and one of the easier ways to join the 6,000 meter club. You'll find small lodges at base camp and high camp, but we wouldn't recommend this hike for a family vacation. The summit day is long and the summit ridge is intense!"

    'description': "Shasta is the tallest mountain in Northern California. You'll need your crampons to summit this permanent glacier. Shasta is an ideal climb if you're training for Mount Rainier or Denali. It's also a popular spot for snow sports. Our Titan snowboarded down after reaching the peak!"

Day one ends at a beautiful lake where you can relax in style. From there, only the serious climbers continue as the climb gets steep very quickly. The summit ridge is an exposed knife-edge. So if you’re wearing a sombrero, it may just blow into Chile. Cabeza de Condor is rated AD+, so \"Be Prepared.\" No Cub Scouts allowed on this one.",
